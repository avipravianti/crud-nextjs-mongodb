This is an app using Nextjs and also mongodb for the database

I also using Material Ui for the table.

There are 2 pages in this web, Home and Add Post.

In Home page, you can see all the GET data, publish button to UPDATE, and delete button to DELETE.
In Add Post page, you can create a new data to POST and display in a Home page

PS: This is my first time using NEXTjs and MongoDb, and I'm still have to learn a lot, thank you
